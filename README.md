This is a java and maven-packaged implementation of the [BioC exchange format](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/)

Initial credits go fully to the authors of the BioC project and specially to the authors of the first java code v1.0, from which this implementation was derived.

## This repository

The initial goals of this repository are:

* make the code a maven project, including the tests
* ease the use of the library by publishing the package in Maven Central and by distributing the code via GitHub

## BioC format

* [Original README.txt](README.txt)
* [BioC.dtd](BioC.dtd)
* [BioC project page](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/)
